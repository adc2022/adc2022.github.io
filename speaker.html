				  <h6><b>Title: </b><i>Data Management for Effective and Efficient Deep Learning</i></h6>
				  <p align="justify"><b>Abstract:</b> In recent years, deep learning (DL) has significantly penetrated and has been widely adopted in various fields of application, including facial recognition, strategy games (AlphaGo and Texas hold'em) and question answering. However, the effectiveness of the models and efficiency of the training process strongly depend on how well the associated data is managed. It is very challenging to train an effective deep learning-based image classifier without properly labelled training data. Furthermore, training efficiency is severely affected by a large amount of training data, complex structures of the models and tones of hyper parameters. A lack of validation for result data and explanation also seriously affect the applicability of trained models. In this talk, I will discuss three issues on how to manage data for effective and efficient deep learning: 1) how to prepare data for effective DL, which includes data extraction and integration as well as data labelling; 2) how to reduce the training time with data compression, computation graph optimization and tensor program reuse, and 3) how to conduct explanation to make the model robust and transparent. Some future work will be highlighted at the end.

				  <h6><b>Title: </b><i>Exploring and Analyzing Change: The Janus Project</i></h6>
				  <p align="justify"><b>Abstract:</b> Data change, all the time. The Janus project seeks to address the Variability dimension of Big Data by modeling, exploring, and analyzing such change, providing valuable insights into the evolving real world and the ways in which data about it are collected and used.  <br>
					We start by identifying technical challenges that need to be addressed to realize the Janus vision. Towards this end, we have extracted and worked with the histories of various structured datasets, including DBLP, IMDB, open government data, and Wikipedia, for which a detailed history of every edit is available.  Our DBChEx (Database Change Explorer) prototype enables interactive exploration of data and schema changes, and we show how DBChEx can help users gain valuable insights by exploring two real-world datasets, IMDB and Wikipedia infoboxes.  <br>
					Based on an analysis of the history of 3.5M tables on the English Wikipedia for a total of 53.8M table versions, we then illustrate the rich history of structured Wikipedia data: we show that tables are created in certain locations, they change their shape, they move, they grow, they shrink, their data change, they vanish, and they re-appear; indeed, each table has a life of its own.  Finally, to help automatically interpret the useful knowledge harbored in the history of Wikipedia tables, we present recent results on two technical problems: (i) identifying Natural Keys, a particularly important piece of metadata, which serves as a primary key in tables over time and consists of attributes inherent to an entity, and (ii) matching tables, infoboxes and lists within a Wikipedia page across page revisions.  We solve these problems at scale and make the resulting curated datasets available to the community to facilitate future research.<br>

				  <h6><b>Title: </b><i>Learn to Index Your Data and Select Your Index</i></h6>
				  <p align="justify"><b>Abstract:</b> Indexes are crucial components in database systems which enable more efficient data access. There are two fundamental problems in database indexing, (1) how to design an efficient index structure for a certain data type, and (2) how to select the suitable indexes to build to maximize the workload performance. With the rise of ‘ML for DB’, many research studies have explored how to solve the two problems above with the learned-based methods. Intuitively, in the former problem, the proposed methods learn the data distribution while in the second problem, the proposed methods find an optimal solution with the learned knowledge in a large solution space. Impressive results have been reported compared to the non-learning methods. In this tutorial, we discuss the design space of key methods for each problem above, present the details of the representative work, and provide some future research directions.</p>

				<h6><b>Title: </b><i>Querying and Processing Bipartite Graphs: Models, Algorithms and Experiments</i></h6>
				  <p align="justify"><b>Abstract:</b> 
					Bipartite graph is a popular data structure, which has been widely used for modelling the relationship between two sets of entities in many real-world applications. For example, in E-Commerce, a bipartite graph can be used to model the purchasing relationship between customers and products. Due to the special structure of a bipartite graph, the algorithms to solve many fundamental problems in general graphs cannot be easily extended to handle bipartite graphs. For example, maximum clique computation is one of the most fundamental problems in general graphs. However, in bipartite graphs, the corresponding problem - maximum biclique computation - involves many new challenges, especially when handling large-scale graphs. In this talk, I will introduce the most recent studies on solving some fundamental problems in large-scale bipartite graphs, including butterfly counting, bi-clique search, core decomposition, bi-truss decomposition, bi-community search, and reachability processing. For each problem, I will first introduce the model and applications, and then explain the algorithms, and finally show the experimental results.

			 <h6><b>Title: </b><i>Temporal Community Mining, Computation and its Applications</i></h6>
				  <p align="justify"><b>Abstract:</b> Searching for local and global communities is an important research problem that supports advanced data analysis in various complex networks, such as social networks, collaboration networks, cellular networks, etc. The evolution of such networks over time has motivated several recent studies to identify temporal communities in dynamic networks. At this tutorial, I will first provide a big picture to overview the diversified types of communities investigated in recent years. After that, I will introduce a set of representative works focusing on temporal community mining, efficient computational algorithms, and the emerging applications to be supported. Furthermore, I will share my team’s recent paper accepted by PVLDB 2022 - “reliable community search in dynamic networks”. In this work, we proposed a novel (, k)-core reliable community (CRC) model in the weighted dynamic networks, and defined the problem of most reliable community search that couples the desirable properties of connection strength, cohesive structure continuity, and the maximal member engagement. By taking this as an example, I will discuss some new types of temporal communities that should pay more attention in the near future. The main goal of this tutorial is to help audiences to know and understand the different applications of community discovery in need, how the community models are devised, the existing research challenges and the state-of-the-arts in this topic. This tutorial is suitable to broad audiences who have interest in database, social data analytics, data mining and AI-driven decision making.

  <h6><b>Title: </b><i>Beyond Normal Graphs: Finding New Research Topics on Complex Graph Types</i></h6>
  <p align="justify"><b>Abstract:</b> The traditional graph data representation is a vastly popular area of research with a plethora of ideas and discoveries. However, in the real world, graphs are often not simply 'normal' instead potentially having many unique properties or additional semantic information which hold the potential for even richer queries. Popular such settings of recent top-tier publications include Bipartite, Uncertain, Temporal, Distributed, HIN/Knowledge Graphs and many more, each with their own properties which can provide even more interesting queries and ideas. Using the well-established Clique structure as an example, we explore how by transporting it from normal graphs onto various alternative settings the structure changes and the information that the structure provides adapts in turn. By understanding each graph type and the potential queries it holds, exciting new research areas can open up.

 <h6><b>Title: </b><i>Three Lessons I Learnt During my PhD</i></h6>
  <p align="justify"><b>Abstract:</b> Doing research has never been easy - basically we are working at the boundary of science, doing things that have never been done before. What is more difficult is how to survive in the academic world as a researcher. You have to be really multi-tasking, capable of delivery high impact research, good teaching, service and of course constantly bring-in research grants to support yourself and the team. I would like to share some of my journeys along the way, and hopefully this can shed some lights on young PhD students and ECRs for pursuing their career path.
